# Final Project

![final-project.jpeg](Final-project.jpeg)

<aside>

ðŸ‘¥ **This is a team project with maximum of 3 in a group**. 
- You can work with teammates youâ€™ve worked with before, or find new teammates. 
- Communicate with your teammates, then schedule time to work on the project.
- Each team will choose which project they want to work on. 
- Dataset will be provided to you once you notify the Instructor with the project you want to work on. 
  - You can send an email to the Instructor as a team explaining the project and requesting for a dataset.
- ONLY use the dataset provided by the Instructor
- An individual cannot be the only one in a team. So start forming your team now!

# Description

Your final project will involve all topics covered from week 2 to 8 by using data to solve a real-life problem. Remember you're doing this with your team.

Youâ€™ve learned a ton about data collection and cleaning, visualization and insight, machine leearning, and model evaluation in this course. The final project is your chance to solve a problem with these from scratch.

## Rubric

Use the rubric below as a guideline for your project as this will be used in grading your submissions.

| Points | Criteria | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 3 pts | Data  cleaning & preprocessing  | Demonstrate clear understanding of different data cleaning and preprocessing techniques by applying them to your dataset. <hr> Clearly document (within the notebook) all cleaning and preprocessing steps. <hr> |
| 3 pts | Exploratory Data Analysis  | Apply both measure of central tendency and dispersion to understand the data. <hr> Perform corellation analysis of the dependent and independent variables <hr> What does the corellation analysis says about the dependent and independent variables <hr>  |
| 4 pts | Data Visualization & Insight | Use at least 5 different visuals to tell a story about the data <hr> Clearly document (within the notebook) 5 different insights you gained from the data <hr>|
| 2 pts | Feature Engineering | Convert categorical or non-numeric features into a numerical representation <hr> Transform neccessary features using feature transformation techniques of your choice. <hr> |
| 4 pts | Machine Learning | Use 2 different ML algorithms to build a model using your preprocessed data <hr> Compare the 2 models based on their accuracy <hr> Fine-tune or improve the model if the accuracy is poor. |
| 2 pts | Model Evaluation | Evaluate the 2 models using a **minimum** of 4 evaluation metrics <hr>  |
| 2 pts | Documentation | State clearly all the processes you've done and why you've chosen to do that. This is different from code comments <hr> Take a cue from the Midterm Project|
| 4 pts | Record Video | Record a video (3mins max) showing what the project is about and **stating individual contributions** <hr> Having good idea of the end-to-end processes in the project <hr> You can submit your teams' video using **[this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDExkyHtKNooCdgaxWl5Y1sqZJ2d0LejP9shKO_7FKG3fkXg/viewform?usp=sharing)**  |
| 1 pts | Deployment | Able to deploy the ML model to cloud <hr> Provides a live working URL to the deployed app in the last part of your `notebook`. I'll suggest you use **render** for deployment <hr> |
| **25** | **Total** | **25 possible points with the bonus, scored out of 25** | 



## Project and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide the project for your final project. The challenge is to
choose a project that is exciting to you, but is not so big that itâ€™s
overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Hereâ€™s some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project youâ€™ll be
able to complete.

- Your final project should be about as complicated as the most complicated
  exercises and projects youâ€™ve already done, or maybe a little bit more advanced.
- Donâ€™t plan to learn a whole new technology for the final project. Plan to use
  mostly what youâ€™ve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the
  things you run into along the way).


## How should you work together?

Youâ€™ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isnâ€™t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how youâ€™ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when youâ€™ll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using [Google docs](https://docs.google.com) or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work youâ€™ve done, and what work is left to do.
