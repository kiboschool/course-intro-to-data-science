## Course Description

Data science is applicable to a myriad of professions, and analyzing large amounts of data is a common application of computer science. This course empowers students to analyze data, and produce data-driven insights. It covers the foundational suite of concepts needed to solve data problems, including preparation (collection and processing), presentation (information visualization), and analysis (statistical and machine learning).

Data analysis requires acquiring and cleaning data from various sources including the web, APIs, and databases. As a student, you will learn techniques for summarizing and exploring data with tools like Spreadsheets, Google Colab, and Pandas. Similarly, you'll learn how to create data visualizations using Power BI and Seaborn, and practice communication with data. Likewise, you'll be introduced to machine learning techniques of prediction and classification, and explore Natural Language Processing (NLP). Lastly, you'll learn the fundamentals of deep learning, which will prepare you for advanced study of data science.

Throughout the course, you will work with real datasets and attempt to answer questions relevant to real-life problems.

## Course Objectives

At the end of the course, student should be able to:

- Explain the basics of data science, its relevance, and applications in 21st century.
- Describe various data collection and cleaning techniques, using neccessary tools.
- Apply different visualization tools to generate insights that drive business decisions.
- Demonstrate understanding of machine learning concepts, and its application to real-world problems.

## Weekly Topics

- Intro to Data Science

## Assessments

Your overall course grade is made up of the following:

- Practice Exercises: 18%
- Weekly assignments: 42%
- Midterm Project: 15%
- Final Project: 25%

## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in [https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

- **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
- **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github.
- **Google Colab** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to analyse your dataset. 
- **Chrome** is a web browser we'll use to acces Google colab and other online resources. Other browsers may have similar features, but the course is designed to be completed using Chrome.
- **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment submissions and give you feedback on your work.
- **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that you get credit towards your degree.

## Weekly Assignments

Each week, you'll have a assignment to complete, usually as an individual. The assignment will bring together the skills you learn that week.

Note that there are no Weekly Projects in weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10 so that you have time to
work on your **Midterm** and **Final** Projects.

## Practice Exercises

Each week, there are activities in the lessons and practice exercises at the end of the lesson. Learning Data Science takes lots of practice, so you should try to complete as many of these activities as possible. They will not be graded, and you will not get feedback on your work unless you reach out on **Discord** or to the instructor directly for feedback.
