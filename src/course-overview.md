### Course Description
Data science is applicable to a myriad of professions, and analyzing large amounts of data is a common application of computer science. This course empowers students to analyze data, and produce data-driven insights. It covers the foundational suite of concepts needed to solve data problems, including preparation (collection and processing), presentation (information visualization), and analysis (statistical and machine learning).

Data analysis requires acquiring and cleaning data from various sources including the web, APIs, and databases. As a student, you will learn techniques for summarizing and exploring data with tools like Spreadsheets, Google Colab, and Pandas. Similarly, you'll learn how to create data visualizations using Power BI and Seaborn, and practice communication with data. Likewise, you'll be introduced to machine learning techniques of prediction and classification, and explore Natural Language Processing. Lastly, you'll learn the fundamentals of deep learning, which will prepare you for advanced study of data science.

Throughout the course, you will work with real datasets and attempt to answer questions relevant to real-life problems.

### Course Objectives
At the end of the course, student will
- Understand the basics of data science, its relevance in the current business environment and its applications in solving real-world problems.
- Learn various data collection and cleaning techniques, and tools.
- Learn how to visualize and analyze data to generate insights that drive business decisions.
- Understand machine learning concepts and NLP, and how to apply them to real-world problems.

### Tools
In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in [https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

- **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
- **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github.
- **Google Colab** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to analyse your dataset. 
- **Chrome** is a web browser we'll use to acces Google colab and other online resources. Other browsers may have similar features, but the course is designed to be completed using Chrome.
- **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment submissions and give you feedback on your work.
- **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that you get credit towards your degree.
