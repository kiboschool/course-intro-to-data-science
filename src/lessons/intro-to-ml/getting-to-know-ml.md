# Getting to know ML
Machine learning is like teaching a computer how to learn from examples and make decisions on its own. Imagine you have a friend who loves to identifies pictures of different fruits. At first, you show your friend different pictures of red apples. Your friend learns from these examples and starts to recognize the differences between different red apples. Later, you show your friend new pictures of green apple, and they can tell you if it's still an apple based on what they learned from the previous examples. That's how _machine learning_ works!

**_Definition..._**

_Machine learning_ is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications or programs to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. As machine learning technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of machine learning in the future. Here are some other examples of machine learning:

- Spam filtering
- Fraud detection
- Weather prediction
- Recommendation systems
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Self-driving cars

For these algorithms, the more examples they see, the better they get at making accurate decisions without explicit programming, just like your friend learning to distinguish between different colour of apples.
