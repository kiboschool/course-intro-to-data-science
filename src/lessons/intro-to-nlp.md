# Natural Language Processing
**Welcome to week 8 of the Intro to data science course!** Last week, we delved into model evaluation techniques. We started with understanding what model evaluation is and its importance in today's world. We went further to explore different model evaluation techniques such as confusion matrix, cross-validation, and regression evaluation. Finally, we briefly explored model selection considerations.

This week, we'll be looking into **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** by understanding its meaning and importance in data science. Next, we'll look at different techniques in NLP, including classification and sentiment analysis. Finally, we'll explore Named Entity Recognition (NER).

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Explain NLP and its application in today's world.
- Describe the NLP pipelines individually or as a collection of processes.
- Classify some techniques as part of text preprocessing or representation.
- Build a sentiment analyzer or entity recognizer models.
