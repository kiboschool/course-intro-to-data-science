# Text preprocessing

<!-- Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity and consistency.

Tokenization: Breaking text into smaller units, such as words or phrases (tokens), to facilitate analysis.

Stopword Removal: Removing common words (stopwords) like "the," "and," "is," which don't contribute much to the meaning of the text.

Punctuation Removal: Removing punctuation marks like periods, commas, and quotation marks.

Special Character Removal: Removing special characters like @, #, $, etc., that might not carry significant meaning.

Number Removal: Removing numerical digits, especially when they are not relevant to the analysis.

Whitespace Trimming: Removing unnecessary spaces at the beginning or end of sentences.

Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms to consolidate variations of the same word (e.g., "running" and "ran" to "run").

Text Splitting: If dealing with large documents, breaking them into smaller sentences or paragraphs can aid analysis.

Spell Checking and Correction: Detecting and correcting spelling errors to improve text quality.

Normalization: Converting words with multiple variations to a standard form (e.g., converting "USA" to "United States").

Contraction Expansion: Expanding contractions like "don't" to "do not" for consistent analysis.

Removing HTML Tags: When dealing with web data, removing HTML tags is essential to extract clean text.

Handling Emojis and Special Symbols: Dealing with emojis, special symbols, and non-ASCII characters appropriately.
