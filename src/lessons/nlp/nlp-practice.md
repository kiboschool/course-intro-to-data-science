### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

You are provided with a set of news articles. Your task is to perform _NER_ on the text and identify different named entities such as people's names, locations, organizations, and dates. Use _tokenization_, _text preprocessing_ techniques, and NER to complete this task.

**Task**: Perform Named Entity Recognition on a set of news articles.

**Dataset**:

| SentenceID | Sentence                                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Kibo is headquartered in New York.               |
| 2          | J.K. Rowling is the author of Harry Potter.      |
| 3          | The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France.    |
| 4          | Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, addressed the audience. |
| 5          | The river Nile flows through Egypt.              |
| 6          | Microsoft Corporation is based in Redmond, WA.   |
| 7          | William Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet.       |

| 9          | Angela Merkel is the Chancellor of Germany.      |
| 10         | The Amazon River flows through South America.     |


### TODO:
- Load the news article dataset.
- Preprocess the text by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and trimming white spaces.
- Tokenize the preprocessed text.
- Use a pre-trained NER model (e.g., `spaCy`) to identify named entities.
- Extract and categorize the identified named entities (e.g., people, locations, organizations).
- Analyze the frequency of different named entities in the dataset.


## Submission
You are required to submit documentation for practice exercises over the course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 2% of your overall grade.

- Practice exercises will be graded for completion not perfect correctness. 
- You have to document that you did the work, but we **won't** be checking if you got it right.
- You **MUST** upload your analysis/visuals as a single file to `Practice - NLP` on **Gradescope** after the exercise to get the grade for this exercise.


## `Happy practicing!`
