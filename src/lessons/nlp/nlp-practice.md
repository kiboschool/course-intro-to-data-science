# Practice
These practice exercises are designed to give you an opportunity to apply and practice what you've learned in the NLP module. They will help reinforce your understanding of concepts like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, tokenization, text preprocessing, and text representations. 

> Feel free to explore, experiment, and ask questions if you encounter any challenges. 


## 1. Sentiment Analysis

You have been given a dataset of movie reviews. Your task is to perform sentiment analysis on each review and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. Use tokenization, text preprocessing techniques, and Bag of Words (BoW) representation to build your sentiment analysis model.

**Task**: Perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews.

### Dataset
Use the same movie review dataset we used in the lesson. This dataset comes with the `NLTK` library.

### TODO
- Load the movie review dataset.
- Preprocess the text by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and trimming white spaces.
- Tokenize the preprocessed text.
- Use BoW representation to transform the tokenized text.
- Build a sentiment analysis model using a classification algorithm (e.g., `Naive Bayes`, `Logistic Regression`).
- Train and test your model.
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Interpret and discuss the results.

## 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
You are provided with a set of news articles. Your task is to perform _NER_ on the text and identify different named entities such as people's names, locations, organizations, and dates. Use _tokenization_, _text preprocessing_ techniques, and NER to complete this task.

**Task**: Perform Named Entity Recognition on a set of news articles.

### Dataset
...

### TODO:
- Load the news article dataset.
- Preprocess the text by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and trimming white spaces.
- Tokenize the preprocessed text.
- Use a pre-trained NER model (e.g., `spaCy`) to identify named entities.
- Extract and categorize the identified named entities (e.g., people, locations, organizations).
- Analyze the frequency of different named entities in the dataset.
- Discuss the importance and applications of Named Entity Recognition.
- Present your findings and insights from the analysis.
