**_In summary..._**

`Data cleaning` in Excel involves the process of identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in a dataset. We can start by examining the data for any obvious mistakes or inconsistencies and then use Excel's functions and tools to clean the data. This may include removing duplicates, handling missing values by either deleting or filling them, correcting formatting issues, and ensuring data consistency and accuracy. Excel provides features such as filters, conditional formatting, find and replace, and formula-based operations that can assist in performing these cleaning tasks. **_It is important to approach data cleaning systematically and document the steps taken to maintain transparency and reproducibility_**.

### 👩🏾‍🎨 Practice: Clean the smell... 🎯
A smaller sample of the global COVID-19 dataset is provided **[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FxxX9wSUMJwsa0xuw8EALSDG4eQcQpxRDCRpAIeDXUY/edit?usp=sharing)** for this exrcise.
1. Create a copy of the dataset for your own use. 
2. Explore the dataset to have a sense of what the it represent.
3. By leveraging your data cleaning skills, attempt the following...
    - Remove duplicate data if exist
    - Handle blank space
    - Convert the column from text to number
    - Implement other cleaning techniques of your choice
