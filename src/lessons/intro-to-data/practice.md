## Submission
You are required to submit documentation for practice exercises over the course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 2% of your overall grade.

To log your practice for credit:

> [Submit a link using this form]()

- Practice exercises will be graded for completion not correctness. 
- You have to document that you did the work, but we **won't** be checking if you got it right.
- You are welcome to log practice that is not one of the exercises listed on the practice page.
- You can submit a link to a colab, github repo, a replit, a Google doc, or some other resource.


Your log will count for credit as long as it:
- is accessible to your instructor
- shows your own work
