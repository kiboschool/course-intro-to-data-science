## Submission
You are required to submit documentation for practice exercises over the course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 2% of your overall grade.

- Practice exercises will be graded for completion not correctness. 
- You have to document that you did the work, but we **won't** be checking if you got it right.
- You **MUST** attempt the quiz `Practice: Football Player Data` on **Gradescope** after the exercise to get the grade for this exercise.


Your log will count for credit as long as it:
- is accessible to your instructor, and
- shows your own work.
