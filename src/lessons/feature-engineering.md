**Welcome to week 5 of the Intro to data science course!** Last week, we looked at EDA and its techniques. We started with the fundamentals of EDA and statistics. We went further to explore descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. Finally, we investigated how to use visualization for EDA.

This week, we'll be looking into **Feature Engineering** by understanding its meaning and importance in data science. Next, we'll look at feature encoding and transformation. Finally, we'll explore different techniques and methods used in feature selection and extraction.


## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Explain the basics and importance of feature engineering.
- Describe feature encoding and transformation.
- List and compare feature selection methods.
- Different feature selection from feature extraction.
