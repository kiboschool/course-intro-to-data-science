# Insight and reporting
Data insight and reporting in data science refer to the process of analyzing and interpreting data to gain valuable information and knowledge that can be used to make informed decisions. By using `interactive dashboards` and `summary statistics`, we can gain insights and present them effectively to help decision-makers understand the data's implications and make well-informed choices.

## Interactive dashboards

**_Definition..._**

An **_interactive dashboard_** is like a digital control panel that allows you to visualize and explore data using different charts, graphs, and tables. Instead of just looking at static graphs, an interactive dashboard lets you click, filter, and interact with the data in real-time.

For example, let's say you have an interactive dashboard for the sales data of an online store. You can choose to view the sales performance for specific months, compare sales across different product categories, or filter data to see sales from a particular region or customer segment. With a simple click, the dashboard will update and show you the results, making it easier for you to analyze the data and make important business decisions.

Some popular tools used for creating interactive dashboards are:

These tools help turn complex data into easy-to-understand visuals, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions quickly. Interactive dashboards play a crucial role in data science by empowering you to explore and understand data effectively, _without getting lost in rows and columns of information_. 

Now, let's look at how we can create an interactive dashboards using one of these tools - _Power BI_.

Unlike static charts and graphs that are fixed and only shows a snippet of the data at a point in time, interactive dashboards allows you to interact with the data and drill down for more insights. However, certain factors needs to be considered before design a dashboard.

### Dashboard considerations
The goal of creating a dashboard is to inform a tagetted audience of insights derived from a dataset. To suit this purpose, the follwing are some of the factors to consider.

- **Audience and User Experience**: Consider who will be using the dashboard and their level of familiarity with data. Design the dashboard in a way that is intuitive and easy to navigate, even for non-experts. Use user-friendly labels, icons, and tooltips to guide users.

- **Clarity of Purpose**: Before creating the dashboard, you need to define its purpose. What insights or information do you want to convey to the users? Clarity of purpose helps in organizing and selecting the right visualizations to present the data effectively.

- **Data Selection and Organization**: Choose the most relevant and important data to include in the dashboard. Organize the data logically so that users can quickly find what they need. Group related information together and use clear headings.

- **Appropriate Visualizations**: Select appropriate charts and graphs that best represent the data and support the dashboard's purpose. Avoid cluttering the dashboard with too many visualizations, as it can confuse users.
