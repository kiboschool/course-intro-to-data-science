**Instructions:**

1. Load the "Adidas Sales Dataset" into a suitable data structure (e.g., DataFrame).
2. Explore the dataset to understand its structure, summary statistics, and any missing values.
3. Create a variety of visualizations to answer the following questions:
   - Create a bar chart or a line chart to showcase the regional distribution of total sales.
   - What are the top-selling products? Create a bar chart to visualize the quantity of each product sold.
   - Is there a relationship between the price per unit and the operating profit? Use a scatter plot to explore this relationship.
   - How does the sales method impact the operating margin? Create a box plot to compare the distribution of operating margins for different sales methods.
5. Put all your visuals in a word document.
5. Write a brief summary of your findings and insights from the visualizations.


## Submission
You are required to submit documentation for practice exercises over the course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 2% of your overall grade.

- Practice exercises will be graded for completion not perfect correctness. 
- You have to document that you did the work, but we **won't** be checking if you got it right.
- You **MUST** upload your visuals as a single file to `Practices - Visualization` on **Gradescope** after the exercise to get the grade for this exercise.


Your log will count for credit as long as:
- It is accessible to your instructor, and
- It shows your own work.
