**Welcome to week 9 of the Intro to Data Science course!** Last week, we looked at NLP by exploring different tools and techniques therein. We started with what text data is and how we can preprocess them. We went further to understand different ways we can represent text to prepare them for further analysis. Finally, we delved into sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER). 

This week, and probably the last lesson week, we'll be focusing on Deep Learning (DL) üòç by looking at what it is, and why it is so important for individual and businesses. Next, we'll delve into the word of _Computer Vision_ and _Large Language Models_ (LLMs) such as ChatGPT üòç. Furthermore, we'll be building our very own deep learning models. Finally, we'll see how to deploy our ML and DL models. 


## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Explain deep learning, including its tools and applications.
- Describe how computers can recognize different objects.
- Build a computer vision model.
- Break down generative AI into sub-component
- Deploy ML model to cloud to provide accessibility (BONUS).
