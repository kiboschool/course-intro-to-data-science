# Intro to Feature Engineering
Imagine a retail business has a dataset that includes customer information such as _age, gender, income_, and the _number of products_ purchased. Their goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a customer will make a high-value purchase.

At first glance, the dataset may seem straightforward, but feature engineering can help improve the accuracy of the predictive model by creating new features such as `total spending`, `income category`, and `age group`.

**_Defnintion..._**

**_Feature engineering_** is the process of creating new, meaningful features or modifying existing ones in a dataset to improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning models, and capture the underlying patterns and relationships.

As an analogy, _feature engineering_ is like a craftsman shaping and refining the materials before building something. It's similar to a painter adding brushstrokes or a sculptor chiseling away to create a masterpiece. By carefully selecting, transforming, and creating features, data scientists can enhance the predictive power and understanding of their models.

This information is not inherently meaningful, but you add up the number of years by doing some quick mental math and find out the person is 22 years old (which is above the legal drinking age). What happened there? You took a piece of information ("09/12/1998") and transformed it to become another variable (age) to solve the question you had ("Is this person allowed to drink?"). -->
