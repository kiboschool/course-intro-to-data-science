# Feature extraction techniques

<aside>

**_Definition..._**

**_Feature extraction_** is a process of transforming raw data into a new representation that is more suitable for machine learning algorithms. It involves taking the original data, which may contain many complex and irrelevant details, and transforming it into a more concise and meaningful representation.

Imagine you have a large collection of colorful pictures of animals, each depicting different types of animals like lion, Gorilla, Hippopotamus, leopard, and polar bear. However, you don't know much about the specific characteristics that make each animal unique. You want to find a way to capture the essential features of each animal so that you can recognize and categorize them more easily.

This can be done by reducing the dimensionality of the data, by transforming the data into a different representation, or by extracting features that are known to be important for the task at hand.

In data science, feature extraction is like finding the key traits or characteristics of these animals that help you identify and classify them. Instead of using the entire image, which can be overwhelming, feature extraction techniques help you pick out **specific patterns or properties that are most relevant** to the task at hand. These features can be things like the number of legs, the shape of the ears, the color of the fur, or the size of the animal.
