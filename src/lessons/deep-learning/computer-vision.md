# Computer Vision
A great application of deep learning in recent times is computer vision. Have you ever imagine yourself in a self driving car? Imagine you're sitting in a self-driving car as it approaches a pedestrian crossing at an intersection. Computer vision is like the car's super-smart eyes that help it understand everything happening around it.

The car's cameras capture images of the road, the traffic lights, and the people walking on the pedestrian crossing. These images are then processed by the computer inside the car. Computer vision algorithms look at these pictures and figure out important things: where the road is, whether the traffic light is red or green, and most importantly, if there are people about to cross the road.

Computer vision helps computer **see** the world like humans. It's not just about looking at pictures â€“ it's about the computer's brain understanding what those pictures mean and making the right decisions. So, when the car detects people on the pedestrian crossing, it knows it needs to slow down and stop, ensuring everyone's safety.
