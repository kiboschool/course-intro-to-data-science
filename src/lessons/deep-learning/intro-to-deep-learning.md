# Intro to Deep Learning
Imagine you're teaching a robot to recognize different types of fruits like apples, bananas, and oranges. You show the robot lots of pictures of these fruits and tell it which one is which. As the robot sees more pictures, it learns to identify the fruits on its own. That's kind of like how deep learning works!

Deep learning is a type of artificial intelligence where computers learn from examples, just like you teach your pet new tricks. Instead of giving the computer a list of rules, you show it a bunch of examples and let it figure things out by itself. It uses `neural networks` to do the figuring out from the examples you supplied.

**_Definition..._**

**_Deep learning_** is a type of ML that uses _Artificial Neural Networks_ (ANN) to learn from data. ANN are inspired by the human brain, and they are able to learn complex patterns in data that would be difficult or impossible to learn with traditional machine learning techniques.
