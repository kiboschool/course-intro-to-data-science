# Build a Deep Learning Model
In previous lessons, we've seen different techniques used in deep learning. Here, we'll delve in on how to build a deep learning model, specifically, a computer vision model. But before doing this, let's briefly look at some tools we need to achieve this task. Also, these tools will be very important moving forward if you decide to further explore deep learning.


## Building a vision model

In this hands-on walkthrough practice, we'll be building an image classification model using an algorithm called `YOLOv5`. To get started with this, there couple of steps we need to take.
- Create an account on **[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)**.
    - Note your `API KEY` after account creation.
- Open this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov5-classification-on-custom-data.ipynb" target="_blank"><b> colab notebook </b></a> and make a copy to work with.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook **step-by-step** and EXECUTE the codes.
- You'll need to supply your `Roboflow API KEY` to download the image dataset.
- A thread will be created on **Discord** for questions, comments, and contributions regarding this walkthrough.

**_NOTE!_**

- You don't need to understand everything.
- The goal here is to have a feel of how to build a classification model.
- After completing the walkthrough on `colab`, watch the solution video below.
