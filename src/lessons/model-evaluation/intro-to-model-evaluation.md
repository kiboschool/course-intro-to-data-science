# Intro to Model Evaluation Techniques

Imagine you have a friend who loves guessing the outcome of football matches. To see how good they are at predicting, you give them a few past matches to predict the winners. After they make their guesses, you show them the actual outcomes and calculate how many they got right and how many they got wrong. This way, you can tell how accurate their predictions are.

Similarly, in Machine Learning, we use different evaluation techniques to measure the accuracy of our models. We split our data into a training set (like studying) and a testing set (like a test). We train the model on the training set and then use the testing set to see how well it predicts the outcomes. If the model makes accurate predictions, it means it has learned well from the training data.

**_Model evaluation techniques_** are methods used to assess the performance and accuracy of a trained model. By using these evaluation techniques, we can assess the model's performance and make improvements if needed
