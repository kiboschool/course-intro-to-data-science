## Air Pollution Regression Evaluation

You are given a dataset containing information about air pollution levels in different cities. Your task is to evaluate the performance of a regression model that predicts air pollution levels based on various factors such as population, industrial activity, and traffic. The dataset is as follows:

**Dataset: Air Pollution Levels**

| City           | Population (thousands) | Industrial Activity Index | Traffic Index | Actual Pollution Level | Predicted Pollution Level |

## Submission
You are required to submit documentation for practice exercises over the course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 2% of your overall grade.

- Practice exercises will be graded for completion not perfect correctness. 
- You **MUST** supply the answers and upload your analysis as a single file to `Practice: Model Evaluation` on **Gradescope** after the exercise to get the grade for this exercise.


Your log will count for credit as long as:
- It is accessible to your instructor, and
- It shows your own work.
