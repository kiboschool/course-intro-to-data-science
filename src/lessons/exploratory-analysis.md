![eda](./eda/eda/eda.jpeg)

**Welcome to week 4 of the Intro to data science course!** In the second week, we looked at different data sources and how to collect data from theses sources. We went further to explore different data cleaning techniques, and how to handle outlier in our data. Finally, we went through data validation and privacy concerns.

This week, we'll begin our journey of exploration and statistics üòç by looking at what it is, and different ways of exploratory analysis. Next, we'll look at exploratory analysis from visualization point of view. Then, we'll explore different descriptive statistics and analysis.


## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Explain the basics and importance of EDA in data science.
- Describe different types of statistics required for data analysis.
- Distinguish between measure of dispersion and variability on a dataset.
- Apply correlation analysis to features in a dataset.
