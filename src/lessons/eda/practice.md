## Monthly Expenses

Imagine you are working with a dataset that contains information about the monthly expenses of a group of individuals. Here's a simplified version of the dataset:

```python
Person:       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Expenses ($): [450, 600, 350, 700, 550, 480, 320, 410, 580, 520]
Income ($):   [3000, 4000, 2500, 4200, 3500, 3200, 2000, 2800, 3800, 3300]
```

1. Calculate the **mean**, **median**, and **mode** of the monthly expenses.
2. Calculate the **range**, **variance**, and **standard deviation** of the monthly expenses.
3. Compute the **correlation coefficient** between expenses and income.
4. Interpret the correlation coefficient value. What does it suggest about the relationship between expenses and income?
5. Create a **scatter plot** to visualize the relationship between expenses and income. Label the axes appropriately.
6. Based on the scatter plot and correlation coefficient, describe the strength and direction of the relationship between expenses and income.


## Submission
You are required to submit documentation for practice exercises over the course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 2% of your overall grade.

- Practice exercises will be graded for completion not perfect correctness. 
- You have to document that you did the work, but we **won't** be checking if you got it right.
- You **MUST** upload your analysis/visuals as a single file to `Practice: EDA - Monthly Expenses` on **Gradescope** after the exercise to get the grade for this exercise.


Your log will count for credit as long as:
- It is accessible to your instructor, and
- It shows your own work.
