# Fundamentals of statistics
Statistics is composed of various elements that work together in collecting, analyzing and interpreting data. To understand the fundamentals of statistics, let's consider a simple example - Imagine you have a bag of colored marbles, and you want to know the proportion of each color in the bag. You randomly pick some marbles and count how many of each color you have.

Statistics starts with data collection, which involves gathering information or observations. In our example, it's the process of picking marbles and recording their colors. The data collected forms the basis for analysis.

Next, we move on to data analysis. This step involves organizing, summarizing, and exploring the data to uncover patterns and insights. For instance, we can calculate the frequencies of different colors or create visual representations like bar charts or pie charts to see the proportions.

<!-- Once we have analyzed the data, we can use statistical measures to describe and understand it - `descriptive statistics`. Measures of central tendency, such as the mean (average) or median (middle value), help us understand the typical value in the dataset. Measures of variability, such as the range or standard deviation, tell us how spread out the data is.

In addition to describing the data, statistics also helps us make predictions and draw conclusions about a larger population based on a sample. This is known as `inferential statistics`. For example, if we have data on a sample of marbles, we can estimate the proportion of each color in the entire bag. -->

**_Definition..._**

Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, and interpreting numerical data. It helps us to make sense of the information we have and draw meaningful conclusions from it.

## Descriptive vs Inferential statistics
Descriptive statistics summarizes and describes data, providing an overview of its characteristics. It includes measures of central tendency and variability. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, allows us to make inferences and predictions about a larger population based on a sample. It involves using statistical techniques to analyze sample data and draw conclusions about the population

In essence, descriptive statistics describes the data we have, while inferential statistics helps us make predictions and draw conclusions beyond the observed data. Imagine you want to know the average height of students in your school. You measure the heights of a few students and get the following data: 

<aside>

```python
data: 150 cm, 160 cm, 165 cm, 170 cm, 175 cm. 
```
</aside>

Now, let's explore two types of statistics (_descriptive_ and _inferential_) using the data above.

### Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics helps us understand the main characteristics of the data without making any generalizations beyond the sample we have. In our example, we can calculate the mean (average) height of the students, which is 

<aside>

```python
(150 + 160 + 165 + 170 + 175) / 5 = 164 cm
```

</aside>

This provides us with a summary of the data and helps us understand the typical height of the students in our sample.

### Inferential Statistics 
Inferential statistics allows us to draw conclusions and make predictions about the whole group based on the observed sample. For instance, we can use inferential statistics to estimate the average height of all students in the school by taking a random sample and calculating the mean height of that sample. This estimate can then be used to make inferences about the entire student population.

**_Lesson summary..._**

Statistics is a powerful tool for decision-making and understanding the world around us. It helps us make informed choices based on evidence and provides insights into trends, patterns, and relationships in data. By using statistical techniques, we can make sense of complex information and draw meaningful conclusions.
