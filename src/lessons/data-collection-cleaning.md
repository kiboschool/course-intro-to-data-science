**Welcome to week 2 of the Intro to data science course!** In the first week, we looked at data science broadly, including its building blocks and workflow, and and also understand data types, spreadsheets, python, and Google Colab. 

This week, we'll be more specific while looking at data collection and cleaning. First, we'll look at different data sources such as databases, APIs, web scraping, data streams. Next, we'll deep dive into data loading and exploration. Similarly, we'll touch on data cleaning and transformation. And finally, we'll look at data validation and privacy.

Whatever your prior expereince, this week you'll touch on basics of data collection and cleaning. You'll also continue practising how to learn and work together.
