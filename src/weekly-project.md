# Weekly Assignments

Each week, you'll have a assignment to complete, usually as an individual. The assignment will bring together the skills you learn that week.

This page will list all of the assignments, so you have a convenient place to find them.

* [Week 1: Student Performance Report](lessons/intro-to-data/assignment.md)
* [Week 2: FIFA '21 Player Ratings](./lessons/data-cleaning/assignment.md)
* [Week 3: World GDP Exploration](./lessons/data-visualization/assignment.md)
* [Week 6: Bank Customer Retention Prediction](./lessons/intro-to-ml/ml-assignment.md)
* [Week 7: House Price Prediction Model](./lessons/model-evaluation/model-selection-assignment.md)
* [Week 8: Sentiment Analysis of Jumia Product Reviews](./lessons/nlp/nlp-assignment.md)
* [Final Project](final-project.md)

Note that there are no Weekly Projects in weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10 so that you have time to
work on your **Midterm** and **Final** Projects.

## Practice Exercises

Each week, there are activities in the lessons and practice exercises at the end
of the lesson. Learning Data Science takes lots of practice, so you should
try to complete as many of these activities as possible. They will not be
graded, and you will not get feedback on your work unless you reach out on
Discord or to the instructor directly for feedback.
